# Personal Dashboard made with SvelteKit

As part of my learnings from [this project](https://github.com/yurith-rubio/Personal_Dashboard?tab=readme-ov-file)

I improved the code arquitecture using SvelteKit. I had the change to see what mistakes I made when organizing the code and learned from it.

I actually enjoyed a lot the learning process and the "easy life" that this Framework offers to Frontend developers.
